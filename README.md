# StarCade

I was looking for a fun father/son project that I could work with my bright, tech-minded 8 year old when I stubled upon the work of Bob @ _I Like to Make Stuff_.  His impressive series on [How to Make An Arcade Cabinet](https://www.iliketomakestuff.com/how-to-make-an-arcade-cabinet-part-1/) inspired me to take on my own version of this classic 80's throwback.  So, fresh off of binge watching the entire Star Wars(TM) franchise with my young apprentice, our theme was immediately obvious: **StarCade** - a space themed battle station complete with lighted marquee, animated LED-powered lightsabers, LED ambient backlighting, specialized sound effects, and even a working Death Star that you can fire on-demand!  (Ok, so we went a little overboard with the special effects, but it's hard to contain an 8-year-old's imagination!)

StarCade is powered by a Raspberry Pi to run the core gaming functions, and an Arduino Uno to run all the special effects.  Eventually I may get around to posting our basic plans for this build, but for now I'm at least sharing the source code for anyone who may want learn from our work.

This is still very much a work in progress.  Hopefully you won't have to wait years to see the final result!  For now,  the 3D model we built will have to serve as a placeholder for the real thing.
